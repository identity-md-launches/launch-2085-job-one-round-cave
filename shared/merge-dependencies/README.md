# Merge Dependencies

Review concurrent edits to a dependency catalog, then check whether the clean
merged result still has compatible versions. This joins line 1's Threeway and
Merge Review with line 4's Offline Resolver and Conflict Core. Python 3.9+,
standard library only. The folder is portable without the line folders.

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 -B shared/merge-dependencies/check_merge.py demo
```

The demo succeeds with exit 0 when it finds the deliberately incompatible merge.
The bundled **real Requests release metadata** resolves in base and in each
branch separately. One branch chooses Requests 2.25.1; the other chooses
`idna >=3.10`. Their text changes do not overlap, but Requests 2.25.1 requires
`idna >=2.5,<3`. The merged catalog has no solution. Its irreducible root core
contains those two requirements; removing either produces a checked assignment.
These are historical finite-catalog observations, not package recommendations.

For your own three workspace catalog files:

```sh
python3 -B shared/merge-dependencies/check_merge.py check shared/merge-dependencies/examples/base.json shared/merge-dependencies/examples/ours.json shared/merge-dependencies/examples/theirs.json
```

This exits **1**, as expected for the demonstrated incompatibility. Output is a
JSON report containing exact input hashes, diffs, conflict regions or merged
candidate text, dependency analysis, and a repeated core/assignment audit.
No input file is changed. Nothing is applied, installed, imported from the
catalog, fetched, signed or sent. It reads no environment or configuration.

Exit codes for `check`: 0 compatible; 1 text conflict or incompatible catalog;
2 invalid input or a clean text merge that is not a supported catalog;
3 search/audit/minimization incomplete. `--max-steps` bounds analysis to
1–1,000,000 solver states (default 10,000), and gives the audit a separate budget
of the same size. The report retains a known incompatible subset when reduction
is incomplete, but the overall status stays inconclusive. Text conflicts never
enter the solver. JSON duplicate keys and non-finite values are rejected.

Catalog format: exactly `packages` and nonempty `roots`. Each package maps
numeric release strings to dependency objects. Constraints support `*` or
comma-separated `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`. This is not full PEP 440 or a
pip/npm installer. Files must resolve inside the current workspace. Each text
input is bounded to 1 MiB and 4,000 lines; the inherited catalog bounds are
1,000 packages, 10,000 releases and dependency depth 200. Stable inputs required;
no atomic filesystem snapshot or hard wall-clock bound is provided.

Ten integration tests passed, including the real semantic conflict, compatible
edits, preservation of files and conflict fragments, duplicate JSON, grammar,
UTF-8 and size errors, budget/minimization/audit incompleteness, determinism,
branch symmetry and CLI codes:

```sh
python3 -B shared/merge-dependencies/test_check_merge.py -v
```

## Provenance and limits

`merge.py` and `review.py` came from line 1's `threeway` and `merge-review`.
`resolve.py` and `core.py` came from line 4's `offline-resolver` and
`conflict-core`. Only the two sibling module lookup paths were adapted; the
engines are unchanged. `examples/sources.json` retains the upstream source URLs
and projection notes from line 4. The three example catalogs vary only roots
over that same release snapshot. `check_merge.py` is the new glue.

The audit uses the same solver to recheck impossibility. It is not independent
certification. Irreducible is not minimum cardinality, unique, or a suggested
repair. Catalog hashes do not authenticate publishers. Compatibility covers only
listed releases and constraints, not interpreter/platform markers, artifacts,
security or omitted releases. Text cleanliness alone never certifies semantics.
ZTO and IMD already suffice for any future coin-related evidence; this offline
workflow needs no token or payment.
